original datasets for our analysis

Our dataset is from: https://www.basketball-reference.com/

We downloaded four data sets in order to complete various data-analysis tasks.

After simple data processing, we delete some unimportant data columns.
We used seaborn to analyze the relationship between variables.
Our [application](https://shihaoling-final-project-project-0vziw8.streamlit.app/) can serve as a small database for querying player's basic information in regular season 2021-2022.
